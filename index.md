## Welcome to my page! 
My name is Arne Bechensteen, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Morpheme team](https://team.inria.fr/morpheme/) in Sophia Antipolis, France. 

### Bio

I am a Norwegian Ph.D. student working in Sophia Antipolis. I have an engineering degree from INSA Toulouse in applied mathematics, with a specialization in [numerical models and optimization](https://www.math.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html). 

I started my Ph.D. in October 2017 with [Laure Blanc-Féraud](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Laure.Blanc_Feraud/) as my thesis director and [Gilles Aubert](https://math.unice.fr/~gaubert/) as my co-supervisor. My Ph.D. is centered around sparse optimization and super-resolution microscopy. 

Here is my [resume](CVArneBechensteen.pdf).
